# Reading Three
As much as I would like to believe technology is created to benefit people as a whole regardless of race, gender, etc.; it is unfortuante
there is some inherent bias within their designs. Many everyday devices are designed with right-handed people in mind because right-handed
people appear to be much more dominant. I am aware of left-handed computer mice and keyboards but their appearnce is so uncommon they
might as well not exist. Most modern buildings do not usually take into account disabled people, such as those in wheelchairs or crutches. 
Even if disability accesss is available, it may be in a very inconvenient spot or requires a lot of effor to get from point A to B. However,
if neither ramps nor lifts are nearby, that someone would have no choice but to wait for a good Samirian to pass by and assist them.
Even in online vidoe games majority of them are designed to punish players for making even the smallest mistakes; causing many in the
community to adopt this "git gud or git rekt" (get good or get wrecked) mindset that ends up pushing away players who are only in it
for the pleasure rather than the challenge.

While it is getting better, women are greatly outnumbered by men within the tech industries. It is uncommon for a woman to reach a high-level
executive position. At best they became project managers but, despite the title, are give little respect by their male peers. In short,
they are paid less and get jobs no one else would want to do. Unfortuantely this carries over into social media where female figures get
harassed much more than their male counterparts. Professional female gamers have seen more harassment then men and constantly get bombarded
by those who believe they are just frauds using their gender to climb the ladder. I do not think feminism has to evolve however, it's 
fundamental principle of promoting gender equality is a very universal idea that is held back by traditional ways of thinking. It is just unfortunate
some would use feminism as a way to disrespect men or others without trying to fully understand its principles. The reading brought up a strong
point of how current technology is primiarily used for the sake of capital gain. Meaning the design leans more towards making more money rather
than the altrusistic mindset of helping the greater good.
