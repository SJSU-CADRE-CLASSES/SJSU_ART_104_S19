Our world today is full of technology that interacts with our daily lives. It could be an abstract
interaction, and virtually. A bias built into technology would be video games where there are obvious 
and discreet sexism incorporated into the games. For example, something obvious would be the stereotyping
about girls are bad gamers. Whenever I play with friends they would joke around how that I suck because
I’m a girl. There are also times where if a girl gets more kills the guys would try to put down each
other’s masculinity by saying “oh a girl beat you”. Some discreet bias I notice are the players in the
game are questionable. For instance, guy characters will have more armor and they’ll be covered up in 
cool gears. But when it comes to a female character it seems like the less clothing the strong they are.
It would literally be a female character fighting in a bikini.

“ XF urges constructive oscillation between description and prescription to mobilize the recursive potential
of contemporary technologies upon gender, sexuality and disparities of power. Given that there are a range 
of gendered challenges specifically relating to life in a digital age -- from sexual harassment via social 
media, to doxxing, privacy, and the protection of online images -- the situation requires feminism at ease
with computation” (0x07). From what I read I felt like the digital age does not have much range in gender.
Usually, in video games or social media, they ask female or male, choose one. However, I do see changes now
where they have other choices such as “others” or even a choice to not choose a gender. In the manifesto, 
they talk about how there won’t be any more operation of power for gender.

The idea of feminism is evolving and I believe it will continue to develop even more. It is during these 
current generations where feminism is liberating where people are starting to stand up to the unjustice.
I think it will soon evolve more because as we all grow there will be new ideas and new injustices that 
have not been voiced out yet. In this reading she wants to cultivate positive freedom by using technology 
as assistance. Xenofemisimwould be a platform to create a new language to help correct the problems we face 
today on media.
