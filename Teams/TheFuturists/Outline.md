<p>2. AI in medical field</p>
<p> -Joseph</p>

The future of Artificial Intelligence in the medical field will save a lot of people’s lives. As AI continues to advance every day, AI in the future will be able to diagnose humans and help people seek the medical attention they need whether it be at home or at the hospital. Humans that need medical advice can potentially be diagnosed by AI through data such as medical history reports, image data, and blood tests that could help clinicians speed up the process of evaluating a patient and receive the help they need. Through a process called Machine Learning, a form where AI can gather massive amounts of data and determine a conclusion for the patient’s condition, it can help people’s daily lives and assist clinicians in making decisions based on what the AI has gathered from its report. With advanced AI it could potentially save more lives by being able to distinguish people who is at high risk and needs immediate treatment right away than to those who are at a lower risk and doesn’t need to seek immediate medical attention. 

Even though Artificial Intelligence will greatly improve in the future it will not replace doctors but are only there to support them. One of the main reasons AI will never replace doctors is that AI doesn’t have any emotions. AI wouldn’t have the emotion to communicate with the person that has medical problems therefore people will always seek a human doctor. There is also a lot of mistrust in AI because they are made specifically to gather data and evaluate based only on those data, so people won’t naturally believe them. Another important reason that AI will only be a support to doctors and are not there to replace them is that AI’s are not meant to become what a fully pledged doctor is supposed to be. AI’s are meant to gather information/data on patients and suggest the possible outcome the patient might have, but it is still the doctor’s job to evaluate the patient’s condition based on the data that they were given. In the near future, AI will be amazing at gathering many information on how to help people that their main job will be to evaluate people based on data to help clinicians save as many lives as possible.
