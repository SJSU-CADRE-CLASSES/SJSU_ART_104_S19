<p> 1. 3d prinitng medical field<p>

3D printing is a great example of technology being adapted in order to serve a variety of purposes outside of its original intent. Originally used to create production pieces in the late 80s, it is now breaking into health education and healthcare. The use of 3D technology in the healthcare industry is estimated to increase by 21% in the next decade. Thinking small scale, one hope for this fusion of fields would be to 3D print specific body parts for surgeons to practice on. Currently, once students are ready to practice operating they take up a residency/internship and are closely supervised by a teacher. This is incredibly stressful for all involved. Until confident in their practice, being able to execute an operation on a 3D printed replica instead of an actual human being, cuts back on many of the risks involved in this learning process. The possibilities for the partnership between 3D printing and the medical field go far beyond this. 

In order to reach the potential of this fusion of fields, we must push the boundaries of what 3D printing even is. Many of the restrictions that 3D printing has faced has been because of the material it can use. However, today the materials list for 3D printing is continuously expanding. So much so, that recently skin cells have been added to this list. With these restrictions and barriers being broken down, the possibilities for the partnership between 3D printing and the medical field are endless. Yes, 3D printed organs for transplants are now a possibility, along with 3D printed skin and even prescribed drugs. But, take it even further and realize a future where 4D printing is a reality. This future technology adds the dimension of transformation through time. 3D printing paired with shape memory  polymers, smart material that returns to its original shape with the presence of external stimulus after being disfigured, creates the future technology of 4D printing. Skylar Tibbits referred to this as “3D-printed structures with an embedded capability of spatiotemporal transformation.” Using this technology and even possibly pairing it with biodegradable and non toxic materials or even soft robotics could change everything in the healthcare industry. We could use this fusion to make small minimally invasive surgical tools that shrink and expand depending on light exposure. It would be possible to create biodegradable, non toxic, 4D printed temporary stitches for various surgeries. The future of micro medical tools provides a more forgiving, and less intrusive alternative to what will soon be outdated technology.

<p>2. AI in medical field</p>
<p> -Joseph</p>

The future of Artificial Intelligence in the medical field will save a lot of people’s lives. As AI continues to advance every day, AI in the future will be able to diagnose humans and help people seek the medical attention they need whether it be at home or at the hospital. Humans that need medical advice can potentially be diagnosed by AI through data such as medical history reports, image data, and blood tests that could help clinicians speed up the process of evaluating a patient and receive the help they need. Through a process called Machine Learning, a form where AI can gather massive amounts of data and determine a conclusion for the patient’s condition, it can help people’s daily lives and assist clinicians in making decisions based on what the AI has gathered from its report. With advanced AI it could potentially save more lives by being able to distinguish people who is at high risk and needs immediate treatment right away than to those who are at a lower risk and doesn’t need to seek immediate medical attention. 

Even though Artificial Intelligence will greatly improve in the future it will not replace doctors but are only there to support them. One of the main reasons AI will never replace doctors is that AI doesn’t have any emotions. AI wouldn’t have the emotion to communicate with the person that has medical problems therefore people will always seek a human doctor. There is also a lot of mistrust in AI because they are made specifically to gather data and evaluate based only on those data, so people won’t naturally believe them. Another important reason that AI will only be a support to doctors and are not there to replace them is that AI’s are not meant to become what a fully pledged doctor is supposed to be. AI’s are meant to gather information/data on patients and suggest the possible outcome the patient might have, but it is still the doctor’s job to evaluate the patient’s condition based on the data that they were given. In the near future, AI will be amazing at gathering many information on how to help people that their main job will be to evaluate people based on data to help clinicians save as many lives as possible. 

<p>Rachel's rough draft research</p>
<p>AI for diagnostics</p>
<p>there is a plethora of medical image data that is sorted and organized everyday, AI would speed up that process making the readings more accurate and time efficient, it could also offer a wider range of medical solutions that one doctor could not
an already successful testing of this idea was done by stanford University research project by the name of ChexNet, they have already programmed AI to diagnose pneumonia based on x ray images of frontal chest views, its a more accurate way of analyzing thousands of different images that even the most skilled radiologist could misdiagnose, reduce errors, in the end the algorithm beat and outperformed four of Stanfords qualified radiologist</p>
<p>AI as chatbots to help people diagnose the problem, traveling healthcare AI bots could be the solution for world heath in areas which doctors arnt widely available, imagine a future where everyone has access to a doctor no matter where they are

<p>3. AR medical field</p>
<p> -Savannah</p> 
<p>The use of Augmented reality has been successful and promising in the medical field. Augmented reality applications are being developed to help train medical professionals and help guide students to prepare them for actual procedures and surgeries. It can be used as a navigation tool for surgical procedures and help enhance visualization in the operating room. It has been used to create reconstructions of the human body in real time to make surgery easier. It has already been applied to neurosurgery and various other surgeries. AR applications can also be used as a therapeutic tool for patients. AR is being developed to help treat people with phobias and other psychological disorders as well. AR adds an extra layer to Virtual Reality (VR) which makes it more interactive and more effective in assisting doctors and nurses during both check-ups and surgery. AR is also being used to help patients and doctors communicate better so patients can have a better understanding of what is happening to them and so doctors can find out if there is any additional problems with the patient that need attention. AR is helping to increase the success rate of medical procedures. AR is in development to become simpler and easier for physicians to use and get feedback from so it can become more available to doctors all over the world. </p>
<p>The technology of AR is still relatively new but research has shown that it can be potentially used for both diagnosis and treatment of patients. AR also has the potential to reduce surgery lengths and be used in more challenging surgeries and procedures in the future. AR applications are still being developed and it is becoming much more accessible and easier to understand; soon these applications will be more widely used and will eventually move to other countries that are in need of this technology. </p>
