<p>2. AI in medical field</p>
<p> -Joseph</p>

The future of Artificial Intelligence in the medical field will save a lot of people’s lives. As AI continues to advance every day, AI in the future will be able to diagnose humans and help people seek the medical attention they need whether it be at home or at the hospital. Humans that need medical advice can potentially be diagnosed by AI through data such as medical history reports, image data, and blood tests that could help clinicians speed up the process of evaluating a patient and receive the help they need. Through a process called Machine Learning, a form where AI can gather massive amounts of data and determine a conclusion for the patient’s condition, it can help people’s daily lives and assist clinicians in making decisions based on what the AI has gathered from its report. With advanced AI it could potentially save more lives by being able to distinguish people who is at high risk and needs immediate treatment right away than to those who are at a lower risk and doesn’t need to seek immediate medical attention. 

Even though Artificial Intelligence will greatly improve in the future it will not replace doctors but are only there to support them. One of the main reasons AI will never replace doctors is that AI doesn’t have any emotions. AI wouldn’t have the emotion to communicate with the person that has medical problems therefore people will always seek a human doctor. There is also a lot of mistrust in AI because they are made specifically to gather data and evaluate based only on those data, so people won’t naturally believe them. Another important reason that AI will only be a support to doctors and are not there to replace them is that AI’s are not meant to become what a fully pledged doctor is supposed to be. AI’s are meant to gather information/data on patients and suggest the possible outcome the patient might have, but it is still the doctor’s job to evaluate the patient’s condition based on the data that they were given. In the near future, AI will be amazing at gathering many information on how to help people that their main job will be to evaluate people based on data to help clinicians save as many lives as possible. 

<p>Rachel's rough draft research</p>
<p>AI for diagnostics</p>
<p>there is a plethora of medical image data that is sorted and organized everyday, AI would speed up that process making the readings more accurate and time efficient, it could also offer a wider range of medical solutions that one doctor could not
an already successful testing of this idea was done by stanford University research project by the name of ChexNet, they have already programmed AI to diagnose pneumonia based on x ray images of frontal chest views, its a more accurate way of analyzing thousands of different images that even the most skilled radiologist could misdiagnose, reduce errors, in the end the algorithm beat and outperformed four of Stanfords qualified radiologist</p>
<p>AI as chatbots to help people diagnose the problem, traveling healthcare AI bots could be the solution for world heath in areas which doctors arnt widely available, imagine a future where everyone has access to a doctor no matter where they are

<p>3. AR medical field</p>
<p> -Savannah</p> 
<p>The use of Augmented reality has been successful and promising in the medical field Augmented reality applications are being developed to help train medical professionals. It can be used as a navigation tool for surgical procedures and help enhance visualization in the operating room. It has been used to create reconstructions of the human body in real time to make surgery easier. It has been already been applied to neurosurgery. AR applications can also be used as a therapeutic tool for patients. AR is being developed to help treat people with phobias and other psychological disorders. AR adds an extra layer to VR which makes it more interactive. AR is in development to become simplier and easier for physicians to use and get feedback from. The technology of AR is still relatively new but research has shown that it can be potentially used for diagnosis and treatment of patients and in more challenging procedures in the future.
