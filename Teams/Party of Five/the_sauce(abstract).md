Abstract

In this time of mass connectivity brought upon by the rise of social media influence, human behavior has undergone a massive shift. Actions broadcast through social media platforms reach viral status through images and videos that end up trending and seen by thousands of people from all over. For our paper we examine the causes of trending as well as its implications outside the virtual world. Our goal is to try to understand the anatomy and lifecycle of a trend and its impact on societal behavior.
