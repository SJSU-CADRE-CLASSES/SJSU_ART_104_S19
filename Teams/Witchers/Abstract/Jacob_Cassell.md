##Esports and Human Competition at the Close of the 2010s

  The Rise of Esports as a global phenomenon is very recent. Only a few years ago it was seen as something that was considered fringe or niche. Nobody expected esports to come anywhere near the level of interest that physical national sports held. These days, watching esports has become incredibly popular, and this can be attributed to massive developments in the realms of social media and streaming services as well as children who grew up with video games becoming adults causing the demand for video game competition to shift. There are several famous games that attract so many of us, Overwatch, League of Legends, World of Warcraft, Counter Strike, to name a few. It is important to discuss the nature of human competition to understand why it is that these games hold such sway over our hearts.
