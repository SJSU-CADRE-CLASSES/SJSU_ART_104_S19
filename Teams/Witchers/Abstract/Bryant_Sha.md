# Abstract
Esports (Electronic Sports) has actually been around since the rise of online multiplayer games but never became more than an extremely
niche community that was frowned upon. 11 years later, technological advancements to online streaming and social media, along with the
explosive popularity of video games helped to bring these virtual athletes into the mainstream. Games such as: *League of Legends,
Fortnite, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, and Overwatch* have a cultural out-reach that touches even those who don't play such games.
What was once a mere fad, has become an international sensation that is here to stay until the ends of mankind.
