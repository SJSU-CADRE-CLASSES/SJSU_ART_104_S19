## Gamekeeping: Gender Disparity and Gatekeeping in Gaming

### Intro Paragraph

There are upsetting sexist things that happen on the internet. Gender disparity, women game avatars, institutional sexism. We stand in celebration of intersectionality, and denounce anonymity for only putting a bandaid on a deep-rooted problem of people being racist, sexist assholes. This behavior is perpetuated by the echo chamber of the anonymous internet.

----------

Topics To Discuss:

-Gender Disparity in esports

-Women game avatars: wtf

-Institutional sexism embedded in games and technology

-Conclusion: What does all this say?
--How do we understand intersectionality in a game space?

-People are assholes and still try to find things to to think they are better than others. "I am grey-er and blobbier than you." Good thing to discuss.

this behavior has an impact on children.

Our stance- we stand in celebration of intersectionality, and denounce anonymity for only putting a bandaid on a deep-rooted problem of people being racist, sexist assholes. This behavior is perpetuated by the echo chamber of the anonymous internet.



# Old Topic

## Esports

Discuss the meteoric rise of esports (only a few years since it started, technological advancements that made this possible)

What makes esports popular (human need for competition, easily accessible, etc)

Speculation on what will happen to society as a whole, not just people who participate and like it, once it reaches the same popularity level as American Football. (Shown on tvs at sports bars, children dreaming of being gamers instead of rockstaars, tank on high school overwatch league on resume, careers in gaming as coaches or paid friends or boosters)

Possible negatives (people losing their life over it as in a warcraft addiction)

End on a hopeful note.
