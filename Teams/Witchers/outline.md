# Outline

Discuss the meteoric rise of esports (only a few years since it started, technological advancements that made this possible)

What makes esports popular (human need for competition, easily accessible, etc)

Speculation on what will happen to society as a whole, not just people who participate and like it, once it reaches the same popularity level as American Football. (Shown on tvs at sports bars, children dreaming of being gamers instead of rockstaars, tank on high school overwatch league on resume, careers in gaming as coaches or paid friends or boosters)

Possible negatives (people losing their life over it as in a warcraft addiction)

End on a hopeful note.
