A Social Numbers Game

	In an ideal world everyone is contributing to their society,crimes are low or non-extent, and everyone is happy with what they are given and have. This Utopia is what a government should be aiming for, and also provide the necessary tools for this dream. A quote from Robert V. Hine in California’s Utopian Colonies ,“A group of people who are attempting to establish a new social pattern based upon a vision of the ideal society and who have withdrawn themselves from the community at large to embody that vision in experimental form." Findings on how China became the prime candidate for the social score concept and how the United States could potentially adapt a similar concept will be discussed in this article. The people play a big role on how far the government can go with monitoring and controlling their citizens.  Overview of China’s bank gave us information on how well China’s economy is doing and why people in China might believe they are doing better with their new government.  “GDP growth has averaged nearly 10% a year—the fastest sustained expansion by a major economy in history—and more than 850 million people have lifted themselves out of poverty.”¹ People in China believe that the government is doing great and questioning the flaws would cause others to shun you. The punishment for having a lower social score in China is devastating and unfair and it affects a numerous amount of people. ”In China, your social credit score determines everything from how much interest you pay on a loan to how easily you can rent a car or get a visa to travel overseas.”²   Government surveillance in the United States have already became a thing, but the government have not released or plan to use the information they gain for public use or make public.  We will be discussing the concept of social score in China and United States, how it works and what effects it has on the people being monitored.

	 Social score is the idea that each individual person in the world would have a number defining their level of influence and/or contribution to their community. This concept in reality could lead to a better society if applied right and the punishment for having a low score isn’t sever and an individual can improve their score by improving their behavior and changing their lifestyle. But when applied wrong it could lead to a society that is easily manipulated and stripped of individuality. The government should try to rehabilitate these members not punish them and trap/contain them in their own environment. The government of China or countries that implemented the social score concept hide all their mishaps or things they wouldn’t want their citizens to see(concentration camps/bombings/massacres) so that they believe their country is doing better and that they themselves are doing better. ““Our lives are getting better day by day,” said Chen Liang, the local official. “For all of these good things, we really have to thank Xi Jinping and the party.””³

In 2006, China started to have Credit Score from the central People’s Bank of China with the same scale as the US of 300 was very poor to 850 was excellence. Inspiring from Credit Score, Chinese government thought that Credit Score could be expanded more than just in finance. As a result, in 2007, China began with the Social Credit Score prototype. Lin Junyue, a chief engineer and researcher of this system in Beijing said “We wanted to explore credit in the broadest possible sense by gathering a far greater amount of information, for instance from the ministry of state security or ministry of industry and information technology. That project was ratified by the national development and reform commission in 2012.”  By 2020, the system will be tested in 43 cities with different names and evaluation criteria. The system will be based mostly from social networks, apps in smartphones and video surveillance. In 2020, most Chinese urban public space will be installed camera with facial recognition under Skynet system. Moreover, in many rural areas, people are able to observe the camera from the village entrance through smartphones or television from the Sharp Eyes project . After all this about how social score is working in China, what about in America? What if we tried this social score society in the United States, and then evental the whole world?

A social score society in the United States might actually work, well, technically it has already started, just not emphasized enough to the point that Americans notice it that much. What I mean by this is that we as consumers and citizens of America are already being tracked. We are being tracked by what we buy and what sites we visit. This is how the “recommended” things appear, because it relates back to what we viewed. “Right now, data collection companies’ main goal is selling you things. But it isn’t hard to envision how a few changes in the market could produce something like our Chinese friends’ Big Brother experience.” Data analyzers can actually take our information and can build a profile of what we are interested into, however, let’s say that we’ve moved a few years later and the social score economy has been adapted to the United States. This means that, exactly like China, those who have high social score would basically benefit extremely while those who do not would almost have no access to anything. This means that even if someone is not a criminal, but they have a low credit score, they are basically rejected from the use of anything. The worst part is that it is easy to bring down your social credit score. “ It’s actually really easy to watch your SCS drop. Hang out with someone with a low score, and your own will go down. You can lose points based on spending time with your family and friends.”
The good thing is that America is a democracy, not a communist country. This means that the people can still try to change how the social score economy works, or maybe get rid of it entirely, if it ever comes to that. We are lucky that we have certain rights that can change the government if it is unfair to the majority of the people, but at this day and age, who knows if the vast majority would actually want a social score economy or society. In the end, based on what China is experiencing as of right now, many people in America would probably reject this whole system and try to find a better revision of the system, because at this time, the system that China has helps with crime and security, but does not help those who were born into scenarios that would put them at the lower parts of the social credit society.

	The extent that these scores can affect one’s life is massive and at times life ruining. Being unable to move forward in life due to a bad score or being restricted from traveling to a new place to restart or find a job seems to make it impossible to climb back up from mistakes or accidents. Most of the benefits from social scores are for loyal and law abiding citizens. There are some rules that would affect you without you knowing. “Authorities have experimented with “social credit” since 2014 in areas across China. Points are deducted for breaking the law or, in some areas, offenses as minor as walking a dog without a leash.”⁵ America and other countries have a score that impacts your life but our credit score system is somewhat recoverable if you are in below the average score. But social score seems to be built on only punishing offenders and not rewarding good deeds. We can see that social score is not the way to deal with troublesome individuals or non-contributing members of society and that the concept still needs to be revised or scraped.
