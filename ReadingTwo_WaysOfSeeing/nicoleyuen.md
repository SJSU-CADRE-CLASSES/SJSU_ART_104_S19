In the first episode, I thought the demonstration of power was using the camera.
He mentioned that the eye is the centre of the visible world and how you can only 
be one place at a time. But with cameras, it gives us a new perspective of what is around us. 
It introduces us to an unknown world where the camera allows the reproduction of the image into
different sizes. I agree with this form of power because how it was explained in the video was 
that images could be viewed anywhere at any time whereas the eyes can only view the world one place
at a time. The content of the placement and surrounds also play a big part because the surrounding 
objects, sounds, and placement also contains the story to go along with the image. 

As for the second episode, it was an interesting topic because it was talking about how we interact 
with society and image. The topic was about nudity and at first, it was questionable to how it relates
back historically and now. But as it was midway through the video where the group of women came together 
to talk about how they perceive themselves and what they want to look like because of society. Historically 
nudity was a big subject in oil painting where one of the interviewers described it as a uniform. This then
shows how what nudity in paintings can give out a certain meaning and how that interaction is still similar 
today where woman try to measure up to the erotic images. 

In the third episode, it talks about the value of paintings and where it came from 


As for the last documentary, it introduced seeing how we are surrounded by images and that it alters our way of
life. It was explained that the screens are a form of language where words and images both appear everywhere we
go. In this episode, it talked about what glamour is since it was a new idea. Historically, people owned classical
oil paintings but the idea of glamour didn’t exist yet. Instead, there were ideas of elegance and grace which are 
similar in a way but still different. What I thought was agreeable is that without social glamour there wouldn’t be
glamour. It is about envy that creates the glamour in the society which still applies to today. Works are of art such 
as the oil paintings give prestige to the scenes in public.
