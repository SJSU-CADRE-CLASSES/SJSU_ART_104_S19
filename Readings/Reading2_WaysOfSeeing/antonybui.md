# Ways of Seeing

I agree with Berger on how the invention of the camera has changed the way we see things and how we see things. It allows us to reproduce moments that we would never have seen before as well as confirm certain things our eyes may have thought we spotted. Photos have also made it possible to replace certain paintings. I have been told by my professors to go to museums to examine certain artworks as they are different when seen in their museums. I agree that you wouldn’t be able to spot certain textures and techniques the artist had done and believe that if you truly want to understand and get a better context on a certain artwork you have to see it with your own eye and not a screen or reproduction. 

I agree with Berger that understanding a painting would be more interesting or personal if you were to take away all the info that connects it to the past. Like how much it’s worth , who owned it, how old is it. I would definitely look at a painting in a different light if I don’t know anything about it. I might think it’s not impressive or maybe I would think it’s more impressive. I think and Berger believes that works should be known for their purpose and what they question or propose. Publicity has taken the place of oil paintings in how it shows possession.  

I believe advertisement has always been pushed to a certain degree but never before has there been such a movement against them. Berger talks about how we see these images and how we always take them with us. Advertisement companies have certain techniques that allow us to remember them and recall these ads.  Either by making them personal or extremely uncomfortable. The pictures/images berger showed us at the start of episode 4 was mostly nude models. 

It seems that oil paintings have changed in a way that isn’t just their meaning. People try to copy certain poses in certain paintings while others copy their meanings through different means. Using oil paintings for advertisement or to show meaning or wealth.Gestures are a big part of a painting as to paint them the person being painted would have to stand still or the artist would have to imagine a gesture that would portray a certain feeling. They play a big part in paintings as well as in today’s images. 

Overall I think Berger brought up a lot of interesting topics on paintings and how art is perceived and how it should be perceived at times. If you take away the value of a painting is it still worth something to us.
