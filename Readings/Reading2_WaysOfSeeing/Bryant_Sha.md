# Reading Two

I agree completely with the statement of artwork playing a role of power and prestige. It is still extremely prevalent in our modern society.
I would go as far as to say this feeling has gotten even stronger. Part of it I believe is because of the societal impact of social media. 
With the ability to easily share photographs with millions of people on the internet, it is not surprising of the lengths some will go to
in order to get those precious likes that many users throw around like candy. As a result, it causes people to be very narcissistic but now
it can be seen from any corner of the internet. However, I would like to mention the women he discusses with in the second episode and one of
them actually mentions humans being very narcissistic by nature. Men and women just show that in different ways. Women base their looks
and personalities off of what society portrays them as. As a result, fashion posters or TV shows seem to indirectly influence the behaviors
of young women showcasing that this is the how you should behave if you want men to love you. For men, they seem to base their behaviors more
on their peers and closest companions.

I read a book recently titled *The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck* by Mark Manson. In this book Manson argues the reason of U.S. and other 
Western countries rewarding those who flaunt a lot of prestige and overconfidence tend to be idolized more then honest people is because of the 
economy of said countries. Business is business and you always want to present yourself as the very best you can be, maybe even go a step
further for the sake of being more successful. As a result, it becomes abnormal to be very honest person because many expect a person
to always be showing their "good" side. Advertisements for fashion products basically tell customers to by said set of clothes or other beauty
products and you will look like a supermodel. Even photographs of fashion models are no longer legitimate since it has become a standard
to Photoshop the hell out of them in order to bring that idealized beauty that is unfortunately scientifically impossible to obtain without
spending vasts amounts of money for cosmetic surgery.
