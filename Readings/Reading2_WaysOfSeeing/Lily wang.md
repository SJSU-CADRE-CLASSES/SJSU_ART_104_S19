His words are incredibly intriguing and I thought right away that it could be defined in several places other than art.

When he talks about perspective and how reality could only be perceived in one place at a time in one eye, and how cameras changed everything,
I thought about how true that was. Before the Vietnam war, the American public did not have a comprehensive view of what war looked like;
how horrific it was, the suffering, the danger, and the violence. But when journalists brought back their camera footage of the battlefield,
the reaction was visceral and terrible. People were shocked at the images they saw on their televisions, and then it led to the famous
student riots of the 70's, calling for peace and justice. It was no longer possible to perceive the world with only your own eyes;
machine eyes came and delivered their visions to people all the way across the world.

I do believe that this applies to 2019 as well, especially with the topic of race. I remember seeing an interview done by the
Youtube channel AsianBoss, where they interview the Korean public on popular and current events. After the release of Black Panther, the 
subject of representation was trending, in which it emphasized the importance of seeing people of different races on the big screen. 
(This can also apply to Crazy Rich Asians, but this is about Black Panther specifically). One man in the video mentioned how he had never
thought of black women as being particularly beautiful, but realized his perspective was quite narrow when he saw the movie. Korea has
the highest ratio of people who believe racial background is an important part of racial identity (according to a survey cited by 
Wikipedia), and it stood out to me a lot. I've heard about race issues from East Asia and Korea especially, but it really drove home the
point that the perception of the world really just comes from screens and images, and how the camera works tirelessly to deliver that.
Unless someone is unusually well traveled, they will likely not know what the world looks like. But with just the click of a button I can
look at photos from places very, very far from me. And this goes for every person with access to these images.

This also applies for gender. As long as I'm talking representation, I might as well mention gender. It's popular to talk about the
objectification of women, and I feel that it is pretty true. When popular media, advertisements, the internet, and pretty much anywhere
images are delivered to a mass amount of people, the images are the only window in which perspective can change. If all people see are
images of women that are deemed physically perfect, when in reality 99% of women don't fit that ideal, then people will start thinking
that women <i>have</i> to look that way. 

Much of European art from the 1400s to the 1900s reflects the perspective of religion during that time. The holy figures from Christianity
were incredibly important to the mass public, and so paintings covered the walls and ceilings and people would gather around an icon,
also painted, as a perception of their worship. But now in the modern age, when those paintings can be reproduced in camera photos so fast
and so quickly, they also become quickly editable and changeable. Not just for comedic purposes, of course, but it does contribute further
to the change of perspective of the power of religion. Compared to a hundred years ago, I think people are a lot less connected to their 
faith after the rise of modern society, science, medicine, and globalization. This is just my own personal opinion and I'm not trying to
take a dig at religious people, but I think religion, especially the very old ones, have started in a very small perspective of the world
and even as it has expanded (the main tenets of Christianity are kindness and compassion, anyways...), somehow it twists under new
environments and situations. I don't think the very (vocal) and bigoted people who call themselves Christian really understand what 
Christianity was about. It's twisted from the evolution of images and the camera. It's easy to believe in a higher power and tradition when
you only have one perspective, anyhow.
