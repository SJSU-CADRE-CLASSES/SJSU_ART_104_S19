<h3> John Berger <i>Ways of Seeings</i> </h3>
<p> John Berger's <i> Ways of Seeing</i> is a four part television series that is analyzing our perception and how we see things. The 
series starts off describing old oil paintings and cameras have changed our perspective on them. We can now create many copies of all these
images and share them in a way that was not possible not long ago. Before people had to travel if they wanted to see all these famous
paintings and now prints and images can recreate these paintings and share them with anyone. A traveler can bring home images of their 
travels with ease. People also manipulate these images and change their meanings of them today.
This still applies today with technology. Technology allows us to share with people we do not know and people around
the entire world. Hundreds of images can be transmitted in a matter of seconds. People manipulate images more often today as well
Applications such as PhotoShop allow for this manipulation to be done much easier and it can be spread much more quickly with the use 
of the internet. </p>
<p> Images shared on social media are representative in our lives because of how much we interact with them. Today social media has 
basically taken over our lives. Many people today do not go very long without interacting with any form of social media. Images from 
social media has transformed our lives as a collective because it allows us easy access to all the same information. Social media has also
become a way of publicizing oneself. It more common that people get famous from platforms such as YouTube or Instagram. The internet is 
making it easy to connect to other people around the world and share information. When this video series was created, the internet was much
more limited but the ideas of perception still applies today with our current technology and developing technologies. Images in 
advertising campaigns are not the only form of persuasion in media. The internet is full of people who are trying to influence us to 
buy products or change our minds on topics. It is full of propaganda and fake news as well and we are constantly exposed to these things on
a regular basis because of social media. I think these same concepts can be applied to google search. Google is full of ads and recommended 
sites to visit when a user is searching a topic. Google is constantly trying to persuade users. </p>
<p> Overall I agree with John Berger on these concepts of perception. I think these concepts still apply today with our current technology.
I also believe that art has played a role in the demonstration of power and prestige in the past because only the wealthy owned art in the
past and today I believe art is still a powerful thing but it is not as prestigious as it once was because we have a different idea of
what art is now. Art is no longer just oil paintings or sculpture; what qualifies as art is much more broad today so anyone can create
art from just about anything.
