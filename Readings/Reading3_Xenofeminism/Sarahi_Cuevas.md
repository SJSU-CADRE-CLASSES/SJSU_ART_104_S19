After reading the Xenofeminism manifesto by Laboria Cuboniks I began to reflect on the gender bias that is embedded in our society that then translates into our lives in technology. I learned Xenofeminism is a movement in current technology against unfair biasâ€™ that occur. I found it interesting to read and I agree with Cuboniks on how societal decisions have for the most part been made by male figures without the input of females. I strongly believe decisions, good decisions, fair, cannot be made with just one point of view. However, this is hardly possible when the people who are controlling the government and technology are white males. Embedded in our society, is a privilege based on how we were born, it is not fair, but it true to our society. How can one perspective possibly understand the discrimination that occurs to, for example, women. As I read this manifesto, it resonated for me because for the longest time I did not feel this sense of belonging within the technology or gaming culture because I did not fit a stereotype. I did not see any people of my gender nor my color that I could look to. As I left on this bias I question why I felt this way and I think of gaming how we are still as women being objectified. Simply, equality amongst genders could make such a difference, but given this bias is so heavily rooted in our history, it makes it difficult. I appreciate manifestos that educate and create a space to understand a different perspective that needs to be heard. This changed when I began to look at how me not following the stereotype may pave the way for others to feel capable despite not fitting the norm in technologies gender bias.
