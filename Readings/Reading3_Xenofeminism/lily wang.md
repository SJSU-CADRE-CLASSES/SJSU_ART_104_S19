In a nutshell, I pretty much think Xenofeminism has some pretty interesting things to say. Meaning, I agree with a lot of their viewpoints,
but there's a lot of parts that feel so general or abstract, I can't really understand them. 

I'm not a huge fan of capitalism- well, at least I'm not an avid follower of capitalist notions- and I don't like the idea of how only
people that work "deserve" pay or compensation, and they don't even get enough of it, such as teachers or other professions that are deemed
not prestigous. It "works" as a system, but eventually it collapses in on itself when the rich get too rich and the poor get too poor.
It's too easy of a system to corrupt, as well. It's really not hard to see why there have been so many Communist revolutions in past decades,
but then those never last very long either. They also end up as systems that are the farthest from its original goals. One great example
is the People's Republic of China, which is governed by the Communist Party, but the higher ups of Chinese society are notorious for 
corruption. If anything, the conversations surrounding social issues are much worse than the United States. Socialist systems, I think,
are the best way to go. Northern European countries are famous for this. Sure, there are higher taxes, and rich people love complaining
about higher taxes (like wow, they're the ones that can afford it but they're the loudest protestors)- but I'd rather have higher taxes
that can pay for someone's life-saving medication than hoard it for myself. Money doesn't do the people any good if it's just sitting in
the banks of the wealthy. It stagnates. Turns out, when people have higher wages, they will spend that money on other services, thereby
sharing that wealth. Who knew? /sarcasm

The questions about gender are interesting to me as well. I like the message, especially because I learned some time ago that gender
based behaviors are things that are learned, rather than inherent traits, a point brought up in the article. People arguing about the
legitimacy of their sexuality (against arguments that call it a choice) say that it was not a choice, but something they had when they
are born. I never thought about the holes of that argument until recently, when questioning my own sexuality. It's something that develops
and changes, but <i>also</i> something inborn, I think. And even then, not everyone has an inborn trait for sexuality, aka asexual people,
who have varying degrees of little to no sexual urges towards other people. So when people talk about "men" or "women", it brings up
an image, something learned and built over time in the listener's mind. What is this collective group of men or women or any other people,
and why are they that way?

Those are questions that are still being answered, and be it far from me to decide it for others, but I at least understand why people have
bigoted attitudes towards it. Human beings do have an inborn trait of being able to recognize patterns, a side effect of higher brain activity
pretty much found in any animal with the five senses. Whether it's for recognizing edible plants, or behaviors of a pet dog, or even just
remembering facts, humans are able to interpret patterns and discern information from that pattern. When someone's only perceived pattern
is facts told by other people, that pattern is able to be manipulated, and thus manipulate a person's perception. If a child is taught
to fear LGBT people by their parents, media, or another source of information, they will tend to do so as well, without really 
understanding why that is. And part of this information would be technology and products sold to the general public.

Technology is made by people; and because it is, it's pretty much impossible to create new technologies in a vaccum. They are created from
a need that needs to be met, or a way to improve something for the future. It's all well and good until you start seeing 'gendered' products
in the store and you start questioning why it was made in the first place. For example, today's cleaning implements, such as brooms or mops
or vaccums, were created to meet the need to clean living spaces more efficiently. No one will mop their floor with their bare hands; they'd
use a mop, or a towel at least. Cleaning is something every human is capable of doing and learning. However, young girls' toys will be modeled
after tools originally made to maintain a home, and even if it is a toy and not functional, it teaches the child that cleaning and household
chores are feminine. Similarly, young boy's toys modeled after power tools will teach that repairing things are masculine. When thinking 
about it, it really doesn't make any sense. A boy is equally capable of sweeping a floor as a girl is capable of using a drill and nails.
But because of this gendered marketing, it teaches those lessons. I've heard of wives and girlfriends who will let their male partner
getting away with never doing household chores or basic things with the sentiment "he's a guy, so he's helpless". Or a man will disregard
their female partner's distress by just calling her crazy and overbearing. My main problem with the heteronormative culture (so called by
the article)is that it treats people born male or female as totally different species that can't communicate effectively- and it's a 
source of humor, a source of marketing, a source of dividing the people. 

I also liked what the article said about abolitionism is just a fantasy. Quoted:

<i>This non-absolute, generic universality must guard against the 
facile tendency of conflation with bloated, unmarked particulars -- namely 
Eurocentric universalism -- whereby the male is mistaken for the sexless, the 
white for raceless, the cis for the real, and so on.  Absent such a 
universal, the abolition of class will remain a bourgeois fantasy, the 
abolition of race will remain a tacit white-supremacism, and the abolition 
of gender will remain a thinly veiled misogyny, even -- especially -- when 
prosecuted by avowed feminists themselves.  (The absurd and reckless 
spectacle of so many self-proclaimed 'gender abolitionists'' campaign 
against trans women is proof enough of this. )</i>

It resonated with me heavily. I think it makes more sense to simply have new terms, such as genderqueer, transgender, or nonbinary-
than to just do away with it all (citing my above remarks about humans being able to recognize patterns) because that kind of thinking
can get way out of control. In fact, it's already happened. The white, hetero male is seen as "default" in many movies and shows
(although I can see it changing. Yay!), and it just erases the discussion of the issue and letting it still run rampant. 
There used to be an internet joke (targeting trans/nonbinary people) that people would joke about identifying as something ridiculous
(see attack helicopter meme) and it delegitimizes those people's struggles and identities. Another meme following this line of thinking
is the "did you assume my/it's gender" meme, where someone would gender something whether by accident or on purpose, and someone would
answer in mock anger "did you just assume [subject]'s gender?!", which was originally poking fun at those who were indignant about being
misgendered. It's an uncomfortable joke to hear, considering people have been evicted from their homes and their families, or even 
killed, for being transgender. 

All in all, I do think feminism needs evolution, but not a total overhaul. It is a term that focuses on gender equality, and not in favor
of women- in fact, facets of feminism deal with toxic masculinity and how harmful patriarchy can be for men, even. But I've never liked
radical feminism (very anti-trans movement) and just like any social and cultural topic, it changes with the times, so it will grow
and change as well. Just not entirely.
