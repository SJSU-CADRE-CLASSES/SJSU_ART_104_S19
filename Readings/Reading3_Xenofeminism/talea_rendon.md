Reading 3: Xenofeminism

There is most definitely a gender bias built into technology. This is not a problem with just technology though. This gender 
bias can be seen in all aspects of life and in all fields of work. We live in a patriarchal society that is nearly impossible
to escape. As Cuboniks wrote, throughout history the "history of thought" has been dominated by men. Science and technology 
are often controlled by male figures. Most leading innovators AND CEOS in technology are men. For example, Steve Jobs, Jeff 
Bezos, Elon Musk, Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and countless others. Not only is this male domination seen in the "career" asspect
of our world but also in education. Even here in SJSU the large majority of DMA professors are white men. So far the only 
classesI have taken taught by a female figure has been pre-requisite classes. The only woman in our DMA program I have even 
spoken to was Rhonda. Even when the technological field is depicted in media, it is often showing very few female figures. I 
acknowledge the fact that feminism in these areas have improved greatly over time but there is still much that needs to be 
worked on. I agree with the reading that as long as information and technology are ruled by the patriarchy, it will be very 
limited and unable to grow.
Feminism is defined as the advocacy of women's rights on the basis of the equality of the sexes. I believe the equality of 
sexes and basic civil rights for all, despite gender should be a given. However, the sad truth is that it is not. I do not
believe that the true concept of feminism needs to evolve yet, equality in all aspects of life would be satisfactory. Many
would argue that feminists are fighting for female superiority, however that is not the case. It is true that there are people
supporting a misandrous agenda, but these people are simply using the feminist movement as an excuse to be sexist towards 
others. True feminists fight for equality, not superiority. I have been seeing more of a push for feminism in technological 
advancements with programs tailored towards women trying to break through the metaphorical glass cieling. A great example of 
such programs would be the Grace Hopper Conference:a series of conferences that focus on research and career interests 
of women in computing.
