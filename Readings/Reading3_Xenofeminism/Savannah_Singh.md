<h3> Xenofeminism </h3>
<p> Xenofeminism has brought attention to the bias and the overall lack of equality in our world. I agree that bias has been built into 
technology since the internet and most of the technology in our world began with white men because women and minorities did not have 
equal opportunity to contribute and help shape the way these things are. I believe that we need feminism to bring equality to every part of life
because people all over the world are still being oppressed and that we should be fighting for people in every nation because just because
some of us have a better life does not mean that we are all free. XF should not stop fighting until every human is equal. That being said
I believe that XF should evolve with the times because things are constantly changing and the way we think right now might be completely
different from how people will think in 20 years. XF is fighting for every single person to be the way they want to be and to help the 
world be more understanding of all kinds of people no matter their gender, race, culture, sexuality, etc. The concept of feminism has 
been evolving since the beginning of feminism and should continue to evolve to be the most inclusive and accepting as it can be. Power
structures are reinforced through the technological status quo because it is constantly being used to oppress people who have less power
or are unable to fight against the technological status quo. The term feminism has constantly been looked down upon today because of 
people who claim to be feminists but are not actually feminists. They use the term to justify hatred and promote inequality and try to claim
that women are better than men, when that is not what feminism is about. I think that feminism does need an updated term because of all the
people who have been actively ruining the way people regard feminists but the concept is not antiquated. Feminism is fighting for equality for all and should be seen that 
way. Feminism is not had outdated concept, just because some people have equal opportunity in certain places in the world does not mean 
that everyone is free from the oppression that exists in the world. Even in first world countries, like the United States, women and people
of color are still not being treated the way that they should be. With the internet, where one does not have to tell anyone who they
actually are, the way someone will talk to you is different if they know how old you are or what you look like. If they have any stereotypes
in their head then they might discriminate against you or treat you differently. So in technology, we still are not equal and should be 
fighting to change the way that "nature" is online. I believe we follow nature for a reason but nature changes and evolves just like
people do and feminism should do the same.
