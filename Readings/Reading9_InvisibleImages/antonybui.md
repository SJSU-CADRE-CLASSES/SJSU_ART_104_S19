# Invisible Images 

Our eyes are amazing in many ways and I’m always grateful for being able to experience seeing art and life. There are obviously things we cannot see/detect with our eyes but it might be a good thing as the range of colors we can see is enough for me. I always wonder how color was made or paint for that matter but I knew missing certain colors together would make a different color at a young age. Using programs will almost never allow mixing of colors instead you will have to choose the color you want now.  I believe this new age is a blessing at times as it allows for replication and access to a wider range of color. The only bad thing about it is that every machine and printer might create a different product in sense of how it reads certain color or how it prints. I had to ask my friend to print something out for me cause the red my printer kept producing was too dark. This also happens with camera has certain cameras depending on their setting will change how the photo comes out. We have the power to change how we view certain things not through our eyes but through machines. 



## Color

Color is very hard to define and at times it is impossible to define. Describing color to a blind person seems like an impossible task and seems meaningless. It would similar to describing sound to a deaf person. Color plays a big part in art and the absence of color as well. We cannot tell what another person’s red is because our eyes are different and the way we process color might be different as well. People that are colorblind see the world differently and at times they don’t see a problem or think they have a problem as comparing colors is not something they might do.
