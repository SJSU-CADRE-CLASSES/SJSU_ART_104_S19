**Poetic**

I felt that Nora N. Khan had allowed me to consider the possibilities of ASI. This has expanded my understanding that ASI is still not present and still not exactly in the realm of possibilities of our present day.

It solidified the idea that ASI is hard to imagine because it is far past our human cognitive capabilities. I think this is exactly why our team members were having a  hard time to grasp the idea of AI in general. We had the conversation of: if AI was built from humans, wouldn’t it just be an extension of us? But AI and ASI can be more than that. We have to imagine that is far less human. This essay helped me form the idea that we shouldn't connect more graduated AI and ASI as something human like, we are only doing so because that is all we can think of as humans!

In her essay, her metaphors are exactly what allowed me to understand the complexities of what an AI could be. I actually agree with this process of teaching because it allows the incoming person to reach a point that is tangible to them. I like that she conducts the metaphor process in her essay, and allows us to understand the point she is trying to make by experiencing it first hand.

One simple metaphor that solidified what she was talking about was when she stated “at lease carry a flashlight inn the dark” . We don’t know exactly what is in the dark, and we can guess all day, but to help us out in the investigation of the dark, the flashlight will help guide us.  This connected to the idea that to explore the ideas of AI, having thoughtful ideas of what AI could be would allow us to better investigate and translate what it is.
