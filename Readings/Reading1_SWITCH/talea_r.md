Web Tribes by Joseph Squire was written in 1997 and takes a critical look at the Web as a whole. 
I found this piece particularly interesting because of how spot on  Squire’s assumptions of the relationship between 
art and the web in the future. He describes how slow the internet was in the 90s and how impatient humans are which was 
interesting because even though the internet has become much faster and much more responsive, people seem to become more 
impatient. If a webpage or video does not load instantly, the user will often get frustrated. Squire also questions the 
future of the web and the part it might play in art as a medium. The Web is described as a tribe with a language of its own.
He acknowledges that he is witnessing the beginning of this tribe, and of this new language. Squire was correct in his 
assumptions that artists would use the web as a way to express beliefs and values to masses of people. Even now, with the 
crazy amount of knowledge that we have of the digital world, much of the technology we use is very new and quickly changing.
Because of this, new media artists have the opportunity to use this rapidly changing medium as a way to express their ideas 
in ways that were never before possible.

Interview: Game Girlz by Geri Wittig and Max Hardcore was written in 1999. 
This article takes a look at the intentions behind a particular website, how the website itself and the
ideas/ message behind it evolves and changes over time. I was drawn to this article in particular because of the commentary 
of lack of strong feminine representation in the digital world in 1999. I was fascinated with the fact that after so many 
years we are facing a very similar lack of strong female representation. Originally Game Girlz was created as “a website 
where girls who were into games didn't have to wade through the semi-nude pictures and scroll through the jokes only a guy 
could appreciate.” I believe this is a huge thing in the gaming community both in the past but also in the present. 
Much of the digital world is dominated by men. Speaking from personal experience, many games are targeted towards guys. 
Companies objectify women and idolize stereotypical masculinity. As stated in the article, it is very hard to find a 
“kick-ass” female character in most games. Game Girlz mentions that on their website they place polls and surveys in order 
to get feedback on what their users would like to see more of. I agree that there is a gap between the developer and female 
user and it is necessary for developers to understand how the user experiences the game (UX), how ALL users might experience
the game. Having a larger female gaming/digital  network would be an important next step for the digital world.
