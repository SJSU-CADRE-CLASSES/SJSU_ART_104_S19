Vangie "Aurora" Beal - Director of GameGirlz.com advocates for a world where men and women could play games together without having to jump
through social hoops and barriers to do so. It is a no-brainer that video games have been a male-dominated activity since its 
earliest origins. As someone who grew up playing video games for nearly their entire life, I am fully aware of how hostile the gaming 
environment can be to female players. Majority of the time they hardly say anything choosing to hide their gender and focus on enjoying
the game. The few times a woman does reveal themselves, they are usually met with friend invites and harassment from guys on the server.  The lines being something between "your a fake gamer girl" or "uninstall and go back to playing mobile games."
Even at professional levels of play, many of these aspiring women get pelted with insults from the fans claiming they are a fraud
if they lose or saying they won with looks if they win. It will take a very long time before their is something that could be considered
a true gender equality among the gaming community.

I believe part of the reason for this disparity would be how majority of multiplayer games are designed. Majority of them feature little 
to no female characters and it doesn't help that their is a strong feeling of testosterone from how these games look and play. However,
I would like to point out that developers are getting better at creating believable, well-written female characters. Blizzard Entertainment's 
*Overwatch* is one of the best examples of inclusivity done right in a multiplayer shooter. *Overwatch's* colorful cast of characters 
are full of life and personality while having very distinct gameplay styles. The female characters in particular fill many of the combative
roles of the game while carrying a strong sense of self-respect that is strongly implied in their many interactions with the cast. Out of
all the multiplayer games I have played, it is the most accepting of female players. In other games I would only get matched with a woman once
every 20-30 or so games. In *Overwatch* I can confidantly say that number is more like once every 5-10 games. Even more impressive is
they usually play in small groups together and are no longer the only girl in a team full of guys.

Lara Croft is infamously known as the sex symbol of video games. This statement still somewhat applies even in the modern-era as she was 
basically designed to be the character gamers would want to play as just so they could be in control of an attractive, gunslinging, treasure
hunter. She was also originally meant to be the few female video game character at the time who could perform the same roles as male
counterparts. Despite the sexual toxicity that came as a result of her games, they've also had a positive impact by setting an example
for other characters in action games. Samus Aran (*Metroid*), Chun-li (*Street Fighter*), and Jill Valentine (Resident Evil) are tastefully
crafted characters who do not need saving yet still being attractive without overly-revealing clothing. I would argue that *Uncharted 4's* 
savior is actually Elena Fisher, the wife of protagonist Nathan Drake. She is ultimately the one who ends up saving Nathan from his
obsessive hobby of finding lost treasure so he can spend time on things that really matter.
