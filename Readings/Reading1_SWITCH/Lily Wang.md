I read the "Future of Gaming" articles by Jenene Castle, John Bruneau, and Marek Kapolka. All of them talked of how the gaming "world" is
continuously coming closer and closer to being parallel to real life- by the way of currency or in persuading people to purchase 
merchandise, or the "gamification" of certain actions. Technology- and those concerning games especially- have progressed at breakneck speed
over thirty years. In the 90's we were looking at low polygon, low power games, but were still great pieces of art considering the
limited resources. Now just in the 2010's, virtual reality is becoming a mainstream pastime than just another concept of science fiction.
Whether or not this progession is concerning hasn't really hit me-yet- because I love playing games and it's simply another activity for me.
But I think the line would be crossed if people started implanting devices into their own bodies to play games. A friend of mine had a
small chip embedded in his hand, so if people could scan it, they would be taken to his personal website. I found that cool, but at the 
same time, it freaked me out. If people could store digital information in their bodies, what does this mean about the future of bodily
autonomy? Could someone create a virus, trick people into scanning them, and then escape prosecution because it was a bodily implant?
But what I do know about technology and its changes, is that people have not stopped wanting more- and developed it further and further,
without really stopping to think if we're ready for it.... ever. 

Video games themselves have already become mainstream. I remember when it was considered dorky or nerdy to be into them- now it's the 
biggest entertainment industry. The only thing stopping it from surpassing movies at the theaters (still the biggest, in my opinion),
is the cost of development. Sure, movies cost a great deal to make too, but to develop a game and having to price it for each individual
player, and the cost of actual production to sell in stores, is also an issue. For movies, all you have to do is to buy a ticket at the
theater- or purchase it online digitally. I think if there's anything stopping games from integrating themselves into our lives to the point
we ignore everything else (which is already in the process of happening, considering the 2016 election), is that the cost of integrating
games into personal lives is increasing. Not just monetary cost, but time cost as well. Avid fan that I am, I can't muster the time to sit
on my computer and play for hours and hours like I used to, and I know it's the same case for lots of others in my demographic, but we 
remain the largest group of players, because we grew up with that rapid development. Even today, old games are ported to new devices
simply for companies to cash in on that nostalgia capital, simply because the biggest engagement group is getting older and wants
the old games they used to know, because the real world gets more bleak every day.(Disney is doing the same thing. I haven't seen much 
originality from their studio that they used to be known for. Now it's just remakes of everything). 

I can only hope that if things get better, games will reflect that, too.
