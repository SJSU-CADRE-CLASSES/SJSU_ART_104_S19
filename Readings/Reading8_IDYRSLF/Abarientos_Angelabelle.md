Identify Yourself
======
by Krystal South

The article first starts out by talking about how computers will never be human like because they will never make choices. An MIT professor, Joseph Weizenbaum, offers that idea that “History makes us human”. Humans rely so much on experience and it is what makes us understand and make thoughtful choices in living today, computers can never compute the same things the same way that we do. And because of this, Weizenbaum states that we should never fully rely on the computer for our own decision making. 

But South takes this old idea and states how computers are actually shaping the way we live now because the limitless amount of information/content/media that we can consume. These are things we weren’t capable of doing without these computers. They aren’t entirely making choices for us, but we it helps us think of better choices, or build ourselves to become a better us because of the information that we gathered on our own time. The computer is just another tool. 

Through the computer we find out that we can extend our own capabilities . South brings the idea of alternative identities to light. A lot of people do this because they believe that they are limited by their true nature.

I never really thought about how separate our internet presence was from real time presence. South states  that when we are in our internet presence, it usually has nothing to do with what is happening in the physical present. That is mostly true. We are almost stepping into another dimension, like we are putting our physical environment on pause, only skipping the inactive moments and pressing play when the original goal is now achievable, like getting food.

“The Internet is a mirror”. It can feel that way. Just like how art can be a mirror. Interpretations can be thought of as things that we see in ourselves, we are just projecting ourselves onto it. But the great thing about art and the internet is that we have the capabilities of creating/changing and not just viewing. South states that in order to keep growing, there must be some form of feedback loop. There is this constant interaction between users to help the content grow, to help people grow with new information. 

The thing about the internet and our identity, is that we can choose whether to let the internet presence effect our real lives or not. We can choose to have a separate identity, and also choose to leave that identity in the realms of the internet and nothing beyond it. We can also choose to become a part of it, to communicate our true selves through it, to build our real selves from it.  The internet is our making, through generations. It can be awful but also amazing. The internet, in the end, is only human.
