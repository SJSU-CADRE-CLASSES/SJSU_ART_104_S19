## Identify Yourself 

  **Online Persona?**

  Krystal South starting off the article by explaining how AI may be a possible aspect of the future yet claims that said AI shouldn't be given actually control in important decision making because "computers will always lack human qualities such as compassion and wisdom". On the other hand, Computers and the internet have become so integrated in our own lives that we are at a point  where it becomes unconscious behavior. It becomes such a problem when we start becoming more attached to the internet, how we start breaking down as the internet breaks down.
  
  **"I donâ€™t go on the Internet; I am in the Internet and I am always online,"** South would say, believing how the internet had shaped her and her behavior. 
  
  This should be considered true for everyone else. From what South claims and from my own personal experience and observation, we have become a bit too dependent with the internet; more impatient we become as it gets faster. We have become reliant of it becuase the use of the internet has made our lives easier, or at least more "convenient", allowing faster connectivity across a boarder audience. The biggest issue, however, I see from this is that while I agree that communication via the internet can let people act as their "true" selves since it easier to speak without the anxiety or other issues that come with in-person conversation, conversely it allows said people to create this fake identity or online persona that doesn't relate to themsleves at all. A problem more so if that identity was made for ill-intent.
  
  In the end, South nominates the internet as "sublime," as in aspiring in a positive note based on how she explains herself. While I can understand that internet came be apsiring since it can appear vast and endless, there is just too many of things regarding the internet that is far from superb.
