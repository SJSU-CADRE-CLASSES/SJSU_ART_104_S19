# Identify Yourself

I do believe one day having a computer inside our heads/brains would be useful but I agree that it seems impossible to compute human flaws/emotions/reactions. Having the ability to run programs in our minds would be awesome and might help me and others with certain problems.Of course having a computer in our minds that can easily be hacked or damage is something we have to take into account. As of right now we can not say that the risks are worth it and I don’t see this problem changing for many of years as our society seems to be very vulnerable to government surveillance and not very good with technology to the level that they should have one inside them 24/7. Having to program our emotions/individuality would be interesting but it would create a society that is very “solid.” What I mean by this is that it would be insanely hard to change someone’s mind or beliefs due to it being actively programmed into them. It is already insanely hard to do this but I do believe that you can change someone’s heart and beliefs if you give them enough reasons to do so. 


## Our online persona

My own persona online differs from my actual personality but I would say it is worse. The fact that I’m behind a screen and miles away from the people I’m interacting with plays a big factor in this and I’m not very fond of my actions and at times can’t tell why I said what I said or did what I did. My personality does sometimes reflect who I am and what I am  more used to doing in real life, usually by not typing or saying anything unless I feel the need to or just being very sarcastic. 


### Always Online

Would this be any different from what we have already? Most people are always online even during work due to their phones and sometimes smartwatches keeping them updated and connected. There are plenty of ways to get connected now that even hospitals are offering free wifi or even planes. It seems that wifi is another necessity in life as some jobs may require you to have access to the internet to check your schedule or even do your work. I recently went to Hawaii and wondered why my family would do certain things or go to certain places. Most of the time they would spend on their phones and shoot photos/videos. They were saving memories and telling others what they were up to. I walked to the beach and thought about how the internet changed us as we sometimes would only do things due to having the access to “show off” the things we did. Even I fell into this and took videos and posted it online for others to see that I was at the beach and just relaxing. It really shows that even in personal moments we seem to try to seek out attention.
