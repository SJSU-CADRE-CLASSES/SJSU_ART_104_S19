One point Krystal South makes that stood out to me immediately was her belief that computers should never be able to make important decisions for us
because they lack human qualities. I was immediately reminded of one of the three possible endings from the game *Deus Ex.* One of the choices
actually involves letting an artificial intelligence meld with the player's mind and rule the world together as a benevolent dictator.
The reason why the AI doesn't try to rule on its own is because it wants a human beings morals and values. While none of the game's endings
are supposed to be "correct" I did feel the AI ending is the closest to a good ending because if an AI melds with the mind of a person of 
good-intentions and a strong moral compass, it would be safe to allow such a powerful entity rule over us.

The necessity of social media and online communities allow anyone to assume identities that would be hard to fake in front of a person. Thanks
to the anoynomity of the internet, some people take the opportunity to express their deepest thoughts or troll others without much consequences.
There's a comic I remember that shows two people talking to each other constantly over social media and in the next panel, when they see each other
in person, are completely silent and unable to muster any words. I am bit a saddened the value of face-to-face interaction has been degraded
because of social media. It's easy to have a hundred friends on Facebook, but how many of those do we actually spend quality time to talk to?
