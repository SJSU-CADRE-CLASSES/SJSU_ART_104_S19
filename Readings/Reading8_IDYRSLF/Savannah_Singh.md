<h1> Identify Yourself, by Krystal South </h1>
<p> In <i> Identify Yourself </i> by Krystal South, the author starts off talking about how artificial intelligence is a possibility in the
future but that we should never rely on computers to make decisions for humans because computers lack human qualities. Computers and the 
internet has been integrated into all of our lives to the point where we do not even think about how much we use them. Technology is 
almost everywhere we go on a regular basis and it is always with us. The moment the internet goes down, we break down and freak out because
of how much we use the internet. The author talks about how her life has changed because of the internet. She believes that the internet
has shaped her and changed the way she thinks. The author believes this to be true for everyone who have technology in their lives. It has
made us more impatient and forced us to be dependent on the internet. We constantly crave the internet, we are addicted and that does not
seem like it will change. The luxury of the internet makes us reliant on it.  We constantly take advantage of the resources available through the internet. The author brings up that she 
always uses the internet to help her write better. The internet has made life easier in many ways as well. It helps people connect easier
and talk to people they would never have the chance to talk to otherwise. Many people have made friends on the internet, myself included, 
and some people believe a friendship formed this way is not the same as making friends in real life. I think that friendships made through
the internet can be even stronger because it is a chance to be your true self with someone rather than making friends with someone that 
may be more difficult to speak to in person and the anxiety can change people from acting like themselves. I experienced the internet 
from a really young age, my dad has always worked with computers so I grew up watching the technology he brought home advance over time. 
The author talks about the many personalities they had on the internet and how they sometimes pretended they were an adult and were able to 
get away with it. I think many of us had similar experiences while growing up on the internet. It was really easy to pretend to be someone 
else. I think it is interesting how the author chose to end this article by defining the internet as "sublime". We all use and abuse the 
internet but I do not think most people would consider the internet to be sublime. It vast and seems endless but the internet is full of 
many things that are difficult to refer to as beautiful or noble.
