Reading #5 Processing Lampreys

Yvette Granata uses photography and search engines in order to create a parallel between the  biology of parasites and a 
digital parasitic process. Granata uses the digital process of coding in order to speak upon the similarities that  biology 
and technology have. Much of technology draws inspiration and functions from nature. In  her works, digital data is being fed 
from an image’s pixel information. In order for this to work, it needs another photograph to latch onto. In this way, the 
process itself as a medium is a parasite. The finished product is only a small part of her work, the real art is the artistic 
process and medium that Granada uses. 
I believe that this article also touches upon modernity and modernization in photography. Modernity would be the cameras and 
search engines, the technology itself. Where as the modernization can be seen in the way Granada (along with the rest of the
world) uses this technology. Yvette Granada starts to break apart the modernization by using photographic mediums in more 
unconventional ways. Building digital pieces in new ways.
Another idea in this reading that caught my eye was the optical unconscious. Granada talks about the unseen that is discovered 
by the camera, “with all its resources for swooping and rising, disrupting and isolating, stretching or compressing a sequence, enlarging or reducing an object.” The camera not only gives us a chance to see things that usually go unnoticed in our day to day lives but it also gives us the opportunity to morph and change what we would see in our everyday lives. This is where François Laruelle describes the camera as just a variable in photo-fictional chaos. It is able to create new worlds from digital data and create an “under-determined chaos.”
As for the article itself, I enjoyed it. The visual breaks between text paragraphs that pictures provided us with were much 
needed reliefs and breaks. Because of this, the article was easier to read and more interesting when paired with photographs.
Granada started the article off with descriptions of actual lampreys which built up a necessary foundation of knowledge that 
brought a new level of interest in my opinion. The article touched upon several different topics that were then all tied 
together at the end. I found this approach interesting because it kept me engaged, consistently trying to put together the 
pieces myself. I also liked seeing everything click into place once I was done with the article.
For my group’s switch project, we are focusing on future technology in the medical field. We started off with three types of 
technology that are already being created and improved on. However, now we are leaning towards predicting future technology 
that has not even been thought of yet. Because of this, I think it would be effective to give background information on
technology in the medical field or to even draw parallels to something outside of technology such as pop culture. This way the
article is more relatable.
