For the 5th reading of the semester, please read Processing Lampreys by Yvette Granata:

http://www.ctrl-z.net.au/articles/issue-6/granata-processing-lampreys/

While reading this article, please consider Dr. Granata's use of processing to explore her main concept. The art that she is creating is deeply intertwined with her process. Is this important to the exploration of her central idea? How does she approach this article in terms of abstraction? Are the ideas that she is presenting theory or practice? Has she successfully built software that is somehow parasitic within the computer?

Once you have read the article, please post a response of at least 500 words considering Dr. Granata's article and how it blends theory and practice. Could this process be used for your SWITCH article? What are the ways that you could demonstrate your ideas through both theory and practice?

As always, please have your responses posted to the class git by the beginning of class and be prepared to speak about your reactions to the article.
