## Processing/Lampreys


I agree that google search gives us a wide range of images when we search for something. It also seems to give us the more interesting photos of what we might be looking for as we might be searching for something more advanced and less structured. I also know that google search is programmed to show the most recent and popular images even if it might not be what you are looking for. For example if you search up “dumbass” into google search and go to images it would show a picture of Donald Trump. The reasoning for this is because of social medias labeling him as dumbass and linking the word to his image. Reddit is a website that is somewhat infamous for doing this to unlikable companies and people. Google has taken action at times to remove these images for certain searches. Whether they accepted money or they took it down as a way to clear up misconception is unknown to most media. Comcast is a hated company for their schemes to ruin net neutrality and as a result media outlets labeled them as nazis, and google search automated searches to comcast images. It seems they were taken down and somewhat monitored. 

I am not the best a processing but I do understand the ideas and concepts that processing allows. It is interesting how similar the processing sketch resembles the Lampreys teeths. I found it really unnatural and creepy. I believe her ideas came across and that her style matches what google search would give you.


### Connections


I believe as artists it is our job to find connections to real life and the unnatural. But sometimes there are things that verge between the real and unreal. The fish Lampreys would be this as we are used to seeing fishes like salmon or tuna. Doing art on these creatures would make it seem like the art is imaginary instead of representative art. These connections are somewhat needed so the viewer can make connections and understand what is happening. There are times where you would not want this. I am not used to creating art that is disconnecting as abstract isn’t my forte. Processing feels like an art style or tool that is meant to create abstract art or artworks that change/move. 


#### Processing

It is an interesting choice of tool to use to make artworks as most of the patterns require extensive work or accurate positioning. But since the artwork consists of mostly lines around a circle or in some cases lines flowing like fishes or tadpoles, it seems like the right tool to use. There are also ways to change the image so it barely repeats or never repeats at all, google search could change over time and if the processing program is connected to the internet in someway it would be the artwork never remains the same.
