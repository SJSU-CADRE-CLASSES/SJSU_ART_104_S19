Dr. Yvette Granata's artwork was beased on a fish called Lampreys. They are a jawless, parasitic fish with a row of teeth that look like
something out of a science fiction horror movie. What's interesting though about the experiement, was the fact that when Google searching
Lampreys, many of the pictures show case its teeth. I initially believed Lampreys might be an invasive species of fish that disrupts
local ecosystems like a parasite. However, after doing a bit of research on what Lampreys really are, it turns out they are a mostly harmless
species of fish that feed of the bacteria of bigger fish. They basically act as the ocean equivalent of a car wash. It proves how the first 
several pictures someone sees, when googling something, could give either very positive or negative first impressions.

Although Google is the world's go to search engine for just about any kind of knowledge known to man, even a piece of technology like that
has its own limitations. After all, Google was created by and is currently managed by humans; who inherently have their own biases and hidden
agendas. With enough effort, it is possible to manipulate the search results of certain keywords. Try Googling the Roman emperor, Nero Claudius.
Rather than seeing the bust or a statue of the infamous Roman emperor, the top Google Image searches instead showcase a short, blonde, anime
character also named Nero Claudius from the Fate franchise. Although I am a big fan of Fate, I find it extremely amusing that a fictional recreation
of a historical figure ended up overtaking the real thing in terms of Google searches.

To go back to Granata's art piece of a photo-fictional parasite, I would agree that photgraphs on the internet can be very parasitic. Since
JPEGs, PNGs, and other picture file formats, are essentially just lines of code, from a certain perspective the spread of photos is the same
as the spreading of code. This is what I believe the abstract digital forms of the pictures of Lampreys are meant to be. A digital fisht that
relies on users to look up and consume this fish while it gives its searchers satisfaction by showcasing the form they were looking for.
