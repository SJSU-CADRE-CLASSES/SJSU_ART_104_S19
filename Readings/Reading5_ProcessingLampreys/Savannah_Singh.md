<h3> Processing Lampreys by Yvette Granada</h3> 
<p> I found Yvette Granada's article,<i> Processing Lampreys â€”Photo-Fiction as Digital Parasite Aesthetics, </i> to be very interesting.
Reading through her process helped me understand her 
artwork better and gave it more meaning. Her pieces can be seen as very abstract if the viewer does not understand what she does for her
precess and how it leads into her process. I believe her process is very important in the exploration of her central idea. Her idea
would hold less meaning without her process. She is very detailed in explaining her precess and process to the abstraction of the 
lampreys that she finds online. I found it interesting how she viewed using Google to find these images. I think it is interesting how
she points out that we are seeing real photographs of lampreys on Google but we still do not understand much through these images because
they are simply images. These images do not do anything that lampreys would typically do so we may be seeing the image but we are not 
actually seeing a lamprey. It seems like she views the images she finds as already abstract so she manipulates or adds to it to create more abstract images
from the lampreys . I believe the ideas she is presenting being practiced in her work. She has been unsuccessful in building software that is somewhat 
parasitic within the computer. She explains that it is similar to a lamprey trying to consume something that it would not gain anything
from, the example she uses in her article is, "Just as a lamprey cannot suck on a twig or a cardboard box for nourishment but requires 
animal flesh, the program cannot produce effects with any-object-it-selects-whatsoever." So she was unable to build something that can act 
like a lamprey within the computer software. A computer may be able to project the image of the animal and explain what it does but it is
unable to do anything an animal such as a lamprey can do.<p>
<p> The topic of my group's Switch article is on the future of technology in the medical world. I think the concepts and ideas presented
in this article could also be used in our group article. I think the way she explains the process would be useful in our article since most people might not
understand the technology and making analogies to explain would be helpful for the readers. I think it may also be helpful to explain why we 
believe certain things will be apart of the future of the medical world's technology. Our article is mainly theory so it may be difficult
to practice these ideas. Our switch article is going to include predictions for the future so it may be helpful to explain what is currently
being used and what will be used very soon in the future of medical technology.
