In Processing Lampreys by Yvette Granata, Granata uses processing to explore images of lampreys by using parasitic code. Granata does this by using photography and search engines like google search to understand the digital parasitic process and biological. In Granata’s work, the code functions she uses are the image file in the fold to distort. It is interesting that Granata’s work moves away from the aesthetic of ‘art’  rather focusing on the process and concept of her work. Another topic talked about by the author was the use of digital cameras to see things that usually go unnoticed, this a topic other authors in previous readings have also talked about and I find interesting how Granata uses this unnoticed perspective to distort and change what we see daily. I overall enjoyed how Granata's work was presented in this reading because it was first more informative and then led to being able to understand how and why she distorted these photographic perspectives.
