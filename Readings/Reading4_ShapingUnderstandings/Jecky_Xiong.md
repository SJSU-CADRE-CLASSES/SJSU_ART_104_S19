Art is something that can put a hole in society if it was erased out of society. Without art, the visuals of a lot of subjects will disappear and we would be almost blind to a certain point. Art has been a part of human history since we were able to use our hands to draw something as simple as a line. We are able to tell stories through art and even write down history, like the cave paintings. I personally believe that art is not meant to be something for monetary gain, but for passion and expression. Yes, in this world today, we as artists have to make a living and our art is one of those primary ways, but in the end, I feel like art is more of a way to express creativity, emotions, and ideas more than just doing it for the monetary gain. It also can serve as a way to meditate as well and just zone out. Art can also help others in visualizing things that they would have never thought can be visualized.
