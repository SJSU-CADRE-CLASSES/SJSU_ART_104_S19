Despite the increasingly digitalized world we live in, I still believe art is important to our society. Without it, we would not have
culture. Artwork basically encompasses a certain culture that contains all of the beliefs and experiences its creator went through
and was inspired by in order to form it in the first place. Without Dungeons & Dragons, the culture of role-playing games would not 
have grown as much as it currently has. Art has such a crucial role in maintaining a culture that entire communities are built around
works of art. Websites like Deviantart, Tumblr, and Pixiv would not existed if there wasn't an active artistic community in the present-day.

I choose to major in Digital Media Art at SJSU because I want to learn some skills and information I need to create art for video games.
However, I don't think it would be end goal; once I get some experience in game development I would want to startup my own studio
and supervise the production of these games. I hate being seen as generic so I, admittedly, like to show off a little and try to be
unique from others. Although I am quite aware that an artist is not as practical as a job as engineering, I think being an artist
requires the person to seek more than monetary rewards in order to be a successful one.

I was already exposed to the internet since being born because I got into online gaming in a very young age. *Counter-Strike* served
as a support pillar for my personal growth. Although I couldn't read, I knew enough that my objective was to kill the enemy team before 
they killed me. I played with children who were likely around my age along with young adults in their 20s. In the pre-internet era, 
I only say it as a gateway to play games with random strangers with the common goal of having fun. Now you have Professional Streamers and 
Let's Players, people who play games for money on the internet. It got so big there is now an audience of people who know a lot about 
games without playing any of it themselves. Even tournaments are shown online and the biggest ones easily amass viewers that equal
the numbers of the NBA Finals or the Super Bowl. I am grateful of the internet for spreading what was once a niche hobby into a global
phenomenon.
