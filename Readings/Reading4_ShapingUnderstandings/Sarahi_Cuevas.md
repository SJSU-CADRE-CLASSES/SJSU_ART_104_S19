Shaping Understandings of Value by Jon Halls and Jaione Cerrato was a reading I found very interesting as it pertained to how art affects society. Art plays such a crucial role in our society, as it is a form of communication. Just like language, society needs it to communicate, so is art. Art is used as ‘language’ to communicate advertisements, public statements, designs of products,architecture, etc. It is all heavily embedded in our culture as a society and needed to function. I found it interesting when the author talks about how our ability to connect with art and feel emotion is a vital part of society and we cannot run without them. Without speaking we can understand or feel what art is trying to tell us, and this is so crucial and vital for humans to be able to function as a society together. Even as we look at our education embedded in our curriculum is art history because the art created tells us a story, it communicates with us, and we need this to understand and gain knowledge. It teaches us where we once were as a society because of the mediums we used, for the most part, historically we look at oil paints, but now there is digital art. That can tell us the advancements that have occurred. Art can make us feel and understand our history and how people felt about decisions. It is interesting how we can see how important it is to our society and how it has always been, yet many artists are not able to live and just be an artist in our society.
