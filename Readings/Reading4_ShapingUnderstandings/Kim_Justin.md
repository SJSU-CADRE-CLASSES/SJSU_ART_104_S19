## Shaping Understanding

What I really got from this is questioning the value of art within a conceptual, a social, and a financial/economical standing point and I will honestly say, from peronal expereience, that I felt that I've been conflicted with this idea for a while.   

There was also one line here thst I felt was very true:

**_"The generation that we are part of is only offered multiple choices, each vying to win. Limited by an education that fosters capitalistic competition, we see the other as a rival instead of a collaborator."_**

To me and to many others even outside of the arts, this feels like, or in some extreme cases actually is, reality. This may, or may not, be the unfortunalte side of the capitalist country that we're living in.
