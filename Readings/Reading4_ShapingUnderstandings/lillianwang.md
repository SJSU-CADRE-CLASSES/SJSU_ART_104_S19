I really had nothing to argue against in this article; everything in it I pretty much agreed with. I think that in this modern society, 
especially after the first couple of industrial revolutions (probably around the World Wars), art has become something secondary or even
optional. In the discovery of new things and the rush to discover more about science, after cultures around the world began to 
collectively realize the Earth is not so large after all, technology really took a huge leap. Just in a few decades, people have made 
astonishing advancements in improving the quality of life and even have started to achieve space travel. But I think that in the rush to
improve and expand our everyday lives, everything started to have a dollar sign attached to it. Everything and everyone is a competitor; 
To improve industry is to improve your own finances, to insure your own quality of life before everyone else. The practice of money,
in the saving and spending, is absolutely not new in human history, but with the advent of new technologies, it became necessary to
trade goods for services, services that took time and training. A doctor may be able to heal the sick, but cannot repair his own house;
a carpenter can repair a home, but cannot farm food; a farmer can produce food but may find himself unable to because of sickness. When
trading their skills for compensation, they are contributing to each other and the community at large.
So where to artists fall in this? "Making art" is something that has taken a backseat to more technical skills, as any person in any
contemporary education system could tell you. It's optional, it's not necessary, parents will tell you to do something that actually
"makes money". I simply think that contemporary society, after living under capitalist ideologies for so long, have just forgotten-
art is just something humans do. Long before we were picking up paintbrushes or typing out stories or tuning our guitars, human beings
have simply used their hands to paint on rocks, shaping clay, and passing down stories and folk songs by word of mouth.
Art isn't simply a skill, something that someone does for money like any profession; it <i>can</i> be, in this contemporary society-
again, art is something humans just <i>do.</i> It's just an intrinsic part of the human experience. Not everyone is going to become
a doctor or an engineer, but everyone has done something creatively at least once. They've doodled, they've daydreamed stories, they sing,
they dance. Someone who says they're not "creative" has just bought into the idea that you have to be "good" at art to create art.
If you're bad at it, you can't make money with it, therefore someone can't be an artist... bullshit! To be human is to make art! In 
this day and age, "art" has grown to encompass many things other than just a painbrush on a canvas. 
A quote from the article:
<i>We cannot quantify how art will affect society, yet it is a vital part of society and its absence is detrimental. Without our
ability to empathize, and connect with one another through emotional intelligence, society will stop functioning.</i>
It basically sums it all up. People make art all the time, and their definitions of it can vary wildly. Humans are not robots in a factory,
after all. Every one of us has our own way of expressing our own life experience, and because we are emphathetic creatures, we are able
to understand each other on a deeper level through art. It's always reflected society and the world itself, responding to cultural,
societal, financial, and political changes. It does not, and never has, existed in some kind of vaccuum.
