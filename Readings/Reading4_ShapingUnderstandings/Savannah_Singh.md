<h3> Reading 4: Shaping Understandings of Value by Jon Halls and Jaione Cerrato</h3>
<p> Art is very important to society. Art helps shape society and it makes the world a more positive and enjoyable place. It is a way of 
expressing oneself and a form of communication. The world today would be a lot duller if we did not make art. Technology and ideas would be
more straightforward with less room to make it interesting or appealing. There are non monetary factors to consider with art. Not all art
is made with the intention of being sold or used to be sold even though most of the time it is used to make money. Art makes the world a 
more interesting place to live in and emphasizes creativity in individuals. It has inspired countless ideas and new creations and inventions.
Everything has a domino effect, ideas that are inspired by an artwork can lead to another piece or a different idea and it shows how art
connects all of us and how we all bounce off of one another. The reasons I am here working towards a degree in art school is because I 
love creating and coming up with new ideas and figuring out how to make those ideas a reality. I have been inspired by all kinds of artists
when I was growing up. I love that the things I saw when I was younger is still inspiring my art and works today. I am in art school because
I want to continue to work on developing my skills and create new works that can inspire the future. I enjoy that I have the opportunity 
to meet all kinds of people and see how they create things and how ideas can change and become better as we interact with each other. I 
think it is economically viable to be an artist here in silicon valley. It may not be easy to get there but I think it is possible to live 
here as an artist. I think it is hard to expect to become successful since there are many artists here but the use of technology and the 
internet, I think artists have a good chance in this area. The internet plays a very important role in the formation of culture. The 
internet has shaped many of our lives, I have grown up using the internet and I still remember when many of my friends did not have a 
computer at home. The opposite is true now, majority of people have access to the internet today. With the internet, we are exposed to more
of the outside world and we have the opportunity to connect with those people and experience other people's lives and cultures through the
internet. It has become apart of our lives and cultures. Its hard to imagine what the world was like without the internet, especially since
I had always had access as a child. I think people were more in little bubbles when they didn't have the internet. It was harder to see
what was happening around the world without going there and actually experiencing it. People would see the news but it might not have 
affected them the same way it affects us today.
