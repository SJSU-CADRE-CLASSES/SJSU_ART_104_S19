For the fourth reading of the semester, Please read Shaping Understandings of Value by Jon Halls and Jaione Cerrato. Please take some time to consider if you think art is important in society, does art act outside of the larger economy, are there non-monetary factors to consider with art? As we are all working in an art school, what are the reasons that you are here? Is it even economically viable to be an artist in silicon valley in 2019?

Consider how technology allows for this model to evolve and how technology-based art can drive this narrative. What is the role that the internet plays in the formation of culture now as opposed to pre-internet?

Please post a response of at least 500 words to the class git and come prepared to talk about your responses to the reading.
