#Shaping Understandings of Value

I always believed and still believe that art plays a huge role in society and everyday life. We may not notice it but it helps reflect our values and helps us understand who we are and what we can do. Art is definity hard to pin down as one thing as music and performances could be considered art. If we are strictly talking about paintings and animations I still believe it helps us see many things that are not visibly seen. What I mean by this is there are problems in society that is hard to explain in words but can be easily explained by a picture/comic. Wage gap/Politics/Social Anxiety and so much more can be explained and help paint a better picture for those that have a difficult time seeing the bigger picture of the problem. 

##My Path

I do believe that an art job is valuable in silicon valley as many up and coming businesses might be looking for an artist. But that isn’t really the path that I wanted. I wanted to create experiences that help people or give them something they won’t forget like the games I played when I was little. I also realize at a young age that automation would one day take certain jobs over and I definitely didn’t want to be replaced by a robot. So I decided to do things that hopefully robots won’t be able to do one day and that is relate to other humans. As weird as it sounds I think and hope I made the right choice as it is something I enjoy.


###Media art 
It is a lot easier to search up a topic and find a comic or art piece about it. As an artist is seems difficult at times to come up with an idea or a way to interpret a problem that another artist hasn’t done. Spreading a common image that you can relate to is simple and quick.  

####Pre-Internet 
The internet was a thing when I was born and I had lived without internet when I was young so I can sort of relate to some experiences. I had to find most images by reading books with pictures and I would find inspiration very slowly by what I read and saw around the neighborhood. The city doesn’t change as much as the internet and it seems like everyday there is something new. I believe memes were not as popular as today. The importance of memes are not seen as a popular topic in schools but I think they play a bigger part in today’s time then ever. It helps us laugh at difficult topics and sheds light on what makes us humans.  Advertisement is seen as an art practice and it can become a job for artists. Before certain technology it would be difficult to create pieces that look realistic and catch audience's eyes but  with 4k video+ and better CGI it seems making things look realistic is simple and quick.
