## Pretend to Be a Bot

It seems the term robot has evolved over the century and pretending to be one is more advanced and actually more confusing.  I have done the robot dance before and I know a lot of people know what it looks like, but it is basically moving your body in pauses and static movement. Robots are still static and unable to move as freely as they want but there are some advance robots that are able to adjust their balance which allows for more free movement. Robots or AIs are able to recognize our faces in other people’s profiles pictures or sometimes random pictures that are uploaded onto the internet which is creepy and it would’ve taken a human quite some time to do the same task. Robots/AIs are expected to make life easier for us. It will be interesting to see a robot create artistic works that speaks to the commissioner , so far most or all Bots use presets or images that are already available for use. They might not be able to think outside the box creatively but at times there are people that want a simple image. 

The artstyle shown in some of the images are interesting as it separates objects into their own color/category and that sort of creates a new artwork and it says something. We can try to give meaning to this but we can not ask a robot why it would do the things it does as it might not have motive besides it was programmed to do so. Human artists have bias and history to their artworks that give it meaning and a stronger impact. They will put their own ideas into their works and it changes how it looks and at times it makes it better. 


Even when we assign a robot to do a task , especially an artwork it will have some bias in how it is programmed. The programmer gets to decide what it can and can’t do. When we are asked to pretend to be a bot we are asked in a way to give up our decision making and common sense. To be a bot is to obey the person giving out commands. People compare being a bot to being a factory worker or retail worker at times as you are unable to disobey or at times do what you want. There are sets of rules that must be followed or you will be replaced/punished or incase of being a bot scraped/reprogrammed. 


### Moving Forward with Automation

A lot of people are against automation as they are scared of getting their jobs taken away. And this article goes into detail about how an artist's job might be automated one day. I have watched a video on automation and it says that even though some jobs get automated it opens up more possibilities for other jobs. We don’t know what these jobs could be but it is almost guaranteed to be more safe and at times easier. It might be looking at the bot’s artwork and reprogramming it if needed or advertising for a bot.
