*Pretend to Be a Bot, Rehumanize the Web
by Sebastian Schmieg 

Some of the underlying ideas of Schmeig is that AI is currently moving humans towards being robotized, meaning we are working to be be the most efficient and fastest versions of ourselves because that is what is currently required to keep a job, to be the best, to continue living really. 

Another idea is that we are being used to be an extension of these apps, these companies. He brings up the term as humans being a “Software extension”.  At this point, because we are all moving towards optimization, we don’t need to decipher whether or not a human is on the other end of things, we just need to know if we are building upwards.

I know one person who works for Uber, the amount of bad stories outweigh the good ones. Some of the users of the app cannot separate the fact that even though they are using a digital service, the people who are working are humans, and deserve to be treated so. These services diminish the appeal to treating humans HUMAN. And the fact that companies like Uber are lean platforms, it doesn’t require the company to be personable to that worker. The workers do not need to be managed by someone physically, or meet the owner of the company. The worker just has follow the guidelines and go. This makes anyone disposable. 

I like that he points out that we are not necessarily going to be fully replaced, or compete against robots. He talks about how robots now are not the best robots, humans are always involved. Our team had a discussion about the idea that AI will have the base of the human mind, this made us think that AI would never be better than humans because they would be built by humans. He kind of discusses this idea, and states that we would still have to be there monitoring and fixing the AI/Robot because some things would be complex and hard to compute by a robot.

Both this article and the previous talk about how artists can take this AI, or ASI and build something that is new, something that will extend our capabilities of communicating differently. But Sebastian Schmieg talks about how we should be taking these technologies and humanizing them again, by “putting the human in the center”. The previous article talks about how we should think about AI/ASI as something removed from our human experiences, something that is alien to us.
