<h2> Pretend to be a Bot, Rehumanize the Web </h2>
<p> The article, <i>Pretend to be a Bot, Rehumanize the web,</i> starts of talking about how Trump hired a Singaporean teenager to convert his powerpoint into a prezi. This caught my 
attention right away because I did not expect that he would use a company such as Fiverr to do something so simple. I enjoyed how 
the interviewee, Sebastian Schmieg, used this as a starting point for his work. I have never personally
worked in this kind of "sharing economy" but friends of mine have worked for companies like Fiverr. They have had both good and bad experiences with it. I have never considered humans as an exI think 
it is interesting seeing this after reading about artificial intelligence. I found it interesting that so many people work as bots and are
forced to conform to the roll of bots with today's technology. It is somewhat like the idea of bots taking over all aspects of our lives
but there are still people working and acting like they are bots and it can be difficult to tell if you are talking to a real human being 
or if there is a bot responding to you online. I find it interesting how artificial intelligence is quickly developing yet we still use
real people to do jobs that can easily be accomplished by a bot. But at the same time if we use artificial intelligence for everything than 
we would have a harder time finding jobs in this field. The ideas of human bots and artificial intelligence are different because you are 
more likely to get a more considerate response from a real person while a bot may not give you what you need right away and making the user's
experience more difficult. Human bots are more likely to think in a less straightforward way as well and can often give you the answers
you need faster. Artificial intelligence does can be developed to be more helpful to users but it still is not has efficient as a human
being. However, looking at the last article it does not seem far off that artificial intelligences will become more useful and efficient 
in the future. I found the idea of thinking of an artificial intelligence as a collective endeavor to be more thought provoking since it is
being developed by so many people and is constantly evolving because of our interaction with the technology. The idea of ASI (artificial 
superintelligence) seems like it would be very far off but it would use this collective endeavor to become a super intelligent program which
makes the idea of an artificial superintelligence more likely in the future of AI.
