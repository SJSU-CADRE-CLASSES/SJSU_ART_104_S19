Please watch the videos and read the full interview. What are the underlying ideas of the work? Have you or anyone that you know, ever worked in the 'sharing economy'? In thinking about the relation to last weeks article, how are these two sets of ideas different? How does the macro level of ASI compare to real world applications and implementations of current AI?

Please have your response to this reading and your next reading posted to the class git by next class, April 9th.
