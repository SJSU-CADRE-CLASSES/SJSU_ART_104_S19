In the increasingly digitalized world we now all live in, new forms of occupation have started to rise. Organizations such as Uber and Fiverr
are some who have introduced a new form of entrepreneur ship. A 'sharing economy' where the services are provided by those who want to profit off
of a side activity. The people working that job technically fall under the umbrella of a company name but they more or less work for themselves.
Aside from maybe some policies to protect the safety of these workers, all of their training and equipment must be provided themselves. We provide
data for this overseer. It is unfortunate that our capitalist economy encourages viewing people as expendable resources.

While I do not know anyone personally who has worked in this kind of environment, I did watch an interesting video about someone who is within the gaming 
community. Apparently on the site Fiverr, there are people who are willing to play a set number of games for a price. In the video I watched
the uploader hired a girl from Fiverr who would play an hour's worth of *Counter-Strike: Global Offensive* for the price of $5. According to the
girl's store page, she has a couple dozen reviews and is quite active meaning that these kinds of services are used quite often. It's strange
how technology helps to connect with others yet devalues the experience of human interaction. Might as well build an AI who could play games
with you.

This interview of Sebastian Schmieg paints a more hopeful future of the continuous symbiotic relationship between humans and technology.
Current technology is somewhat oriented towards streamlining complex processes as much as possible. This is also reflected in our lives as
college students. Programs like Canvas unify upcoming class assignments and announcements into a easily accessible unified hub. Despite utility
Canvas provides, it's still being maintained by a group of human beings. There's alerts about upcoming maintenence periods. Over Summer or Winter
Breaks, Canvas occassionally goes through some UI overhauls to simplify its usage even further. Rather than try to reject technology, I believe
it's better to embrace its faults and continuously work to improve it. Even AIs have their biases because they were created by a human in the
first place. If it became self-aware, it's knowledge could really only go as far as what we humans train it to recognize.
