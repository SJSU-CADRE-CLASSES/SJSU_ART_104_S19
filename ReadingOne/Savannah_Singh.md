<h3> Reading Response #1</h3>
<h5> The "Hoover" Project, Kelvin Chan 1/1/1997</h5>
<p> I thought this to be an interesting read because the topic was about placing surveillance in individual homes. 
It described how surveillance would develop with the use of the internet and how the project described in this article is what is 
currently happening in the world. A lot of people today have cameras in their houses monitoring the area around them and they can easily 
check if anything is happening through their phone or computer at any time. The article also described Big Brotherism and how the
internet can be used to find out if someone is going to be a serial killer. I thought it was interesting that they brought that up because 
today no matter where we go, there is almost always some kind of surveillance there, whether its security or actual cameras, watching our 
every move. Technology is developing to the point where we even have facial recognition and can easily find someone if they go missing
or if they are wanted for some kind of crime. Technology has been taking over our lives since this article was written and the author most 
likely didn't think surveillance would at the state it is when this technology was still in development. 
<h5> Currents Art Review, Jason Challas 1/1/1997</h5>
<p> I found this interesting because it was based on a show for digital work and today we still do not have much computer art in galleries
or museums. Digital work and technology are still not seen as art even though they should be. One of the pieces in the review
I found to be fun and interesting was <i>Donation Box</i> because it was an interactive piece that spat back change at you if you placed 
that in and it would happily accept dollar bills. The piece would respond based on what you put inside. I have never really thought about 
digital artwork from before the 2000s so it is interesting to read about ones that were made before or around the same time that I was 
born. I also enjoyed how different these art pieces were even though they were grouped together for one big show. It shows how much 
technology could do at that time. Comparing then to now, we have more advanced technology and in general it has become a lot easier to 
create these types of artwork. So when I see an older digital art piece, I can now see how much more difficult it was to make it before 
compared to if I were to try and replicate it today. I think the show, <i>Currents</i>, was probably really important to digital artists 
when it wasn't considered an art and I think its important to recognize that there were shows like this one when digital art was just 
starting out.
