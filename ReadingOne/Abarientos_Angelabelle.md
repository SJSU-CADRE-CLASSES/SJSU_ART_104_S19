*Are You There?* by Liz Solo.
---
During the time this article was written, I assume that it was a part of the earliest renditions of virtual space.  
Solo states that a lot of the things she performed were possibly the first iterations of them done in a specific  
virtual space like Second Life (A Virtual World and Role Playing Game).  
  
Liz Solo is a cross-platform interventionist artist who specializes in performance art. One thing that I found  
interesting was her inclination towards digital media and the virtual space.  
Her connections were small at first, as she modified the stage of her performance piece with installations, lights,  
videos etc. It took one artist, Jeremy Owen Turner, to open her eyes to the virtual world and suggest that she can  
change more than the space that was tangible to her; That now she had a space that had almost infinite possibilities.  
It was truly humbling to read about how she got there.  
  
One of the thing that was still relevant was the idea that you could connect to someone across the globe.  
A lot of us today are desensitized by this great power because it is part of every day life, but to Solo  
it was probably the most astonishing thing to be able to do. She was collaborating with artists from Asia,  
India, ETC. And some of the artworks were worked on in real time in a space that they, virtually,  were all in. 
  
At one point during her journey in the virtual world, she states, “The real world has entered the virtual space”.   
But what she defined as the real world peaked my interest. It wasn’t videos of human beings, or nature; It was the   
connection to media feeds and websites due to the ability of live streaming. It seemed as though anything dealing   
with the complications of real life situations outside of the premise of Second Life, was considered the “real world”,   
even it was also a digital space. The contradictions there to me is that during our time now, anyone could make a fake   
website, anyone could have a media feed that could be total nonsense. It makes me question what a website and a   
media feed were to them during the time this article was written.  
  
She then wants to bring the real world into the virtual space. She starts writing about how her virtual marches and   
political pieces in the online multiplayer games, like World of Warcraft (WOW),  encourage real world peaceful social   
interactions. The question here is, should she encourage real world interactions where the idea of being in a virtual   
space nowadays is to “escape” real world connections and problems? It made me start thinking about how a virtual space   
has no complete censor. That people can use it as grossly as they want to. It also brought up the idea of cyber-bullying.   
In a world where people might find her actions annoying, it was smart. There are so many users on these platforms!   
She was sending message virtually around the world to stimulate a real world conversation.
