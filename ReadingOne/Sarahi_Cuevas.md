“Biocurious” by Sara Gevurtz (October 28, 2013)

Biocurious by Sara Gevurtz was an interesting article that explores the integration of biology in artistic practices. Gevurtz mentions how in the past it was difficult for artists to truly work with biology and often times if they were interested in biology, the furthest it could be explored was through drawing. Access to biological resources was very limited because it was often only accessible to well-funded institutions. As a result, creating art using tissues and living organisms has only been recently explored by artists in the early 2000s. BioCurious is a open place for anyone to use resources, “ biology should be accessible, affordable, and open to everyone. We’ve built a community biology lab for amateurs, inventors, entrepreneurs, and anyone who wants to experiment ” This allows for the artist to work with biology through genetically engineered bacteria and even sequence DNA. After reading this article, I found it surprising how recent biology and art have just been explored due to the lack of resources available, but I am glad places like BioCurious are opening and allowing for more exploration within a wider variety of individuals. 

“Neuroscience, memory, and art: Deborah Aschheim” by Sara Gevurtz (October 28, 2013)

Neuroscience, memory, and art: Deborah Aschheim was a really fascinating article exploring the medical community in order to create art that explores memory, memory loss, and place. Aschheims exploration of memory was because of the history of Alzheimer’s disease in her family. She began to meet with researches and doctors on a regular basis before creating her work. I found it interesting how she uses sound in her work, she tends to collaborate with musicians because it gives “a more sensorial or emotional feel”. I find it interesting how biology and art are more recently being explored together and how an artist can use biology to evoke emotional feelings based on the research.
