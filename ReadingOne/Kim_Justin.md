### "The Function of Dysfunction" from Switch 23

"The Function of Dysfunction" from Switch 23 disscusses the aspects of dysfunction. Dore Bowen sets a tone on how artists are protrayed in writing as he discusses the artist that *"reconfigured the world."* Bowen discribes artists that created a dysfunctional enviroment and how that dismantling or reorganizaning either a object of equipment brings out some unknown potential, Equipment in this context being the two categories that make up the phase as the form and material according to Bowen. Creating said environments and creating new mediums is what influences new ideas for other artists. the equipment itself can be part of the art that provides a beter grasp what an artist con really do. 

Applying that to today's culture, maybe today's artists will found the best inspiration from a dysfunctional evnironment. At this day and age artists have practiced with nearly every medium for some period of time now till a point where both the audience and aspiring artists may see art in those mediums as repeatitive or overdone. It's hard to express the art when you are quickly categortized. Maybe like the early artists from Bowen's time, our early artists needs that same inspiration, taking apart and rearranging not only the medium but also the tools to make it to create unimagined work that will allow new artists to explore with new mediums and creating a cycle that will repeat with creatativeity.

*“I am still a victim of chess. It has all the beauty of art—and much more. It cannot be commercialized. Chess is much purer than art in its social position,”* Duchamp had once said. 

However, in terms of new technology, his passions are overlooked in discussions despite some of his work taking influence from said technology like his *Nude Descending A Staircase* for example. Kildall then creates Playing Duchamp stating that it's *"a statement about Duchamp’s place in the art world and the role chess plays in his art. For Duchamp, the game is played out in the mind and the beauty is found in the moves,"* and challenges us to rethink art’s purpose, the place of new media, and video games within context and asks us to reevaluate our relationship to the late artist.
